# ESP-CRYPTOAUTHLIB

This is a port of Microchip's [cryptoauthlib](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/cryptoauthlib) for ESP-IDF. It contains necessary build support to use cryptoauthlib with ESP-IDF.

The  `esp_cryptoauthlib_utility` has been removed in this fork. Instead, users should refer to [Provision ECC608](https://github.com/PBearson/Provision-ECC608) for provisioning the ATECC608A with their ESP32-WROOM-32.
